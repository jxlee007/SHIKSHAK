## 🎯 **Module Overview**

**Sikshak operates as a comprehensive educational module within the unified AssistantPro platform**, leveraging the established AI foundation and real-world data from other modules to create personalized, culturally-aware learning experiences.

### **Core Educational Vision**

The idea of using computers to help people learn things has been a dream of computer researchers going back to the 1940s. With AI, we think it's finally possible to build a truly personal tutor for everyone. The latest reasoning capabilities let AI break down complex topics step by step, explaining even the most complicated subjects in a straightforward way.

**Key Innovation**: Multimodal AI tutors that can present concepts by generating animations, manipulating 3D objects, and explaining concepts with voice - all while maintaining deep cultural sensitivity for Indian learners.
