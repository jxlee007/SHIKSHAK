🔈 Text-to-Speech (TTS)	Convert assistant responses via /text-to-speech (Bulbul voices) 
📝 Memory & History	Save each user & assistant message into local SQLite for continuity
📄 Document Parsing	Allow users to upload docs and parse using /parse (structured output) 
📊 Call Analytics (Optional)	Analyze voice-call files via /call-analytics for summary or insight extraction 
🔄 Transcription + Translate	Optionally use /speech-to-text-translate for direct translation pipelines 
🗣️ Transliteration & Text Translate (Optional)	/transliterate for script conversion, /translate for document & chat text across Indic languages 
✨ Local Persistence	Use SQLite DB to store conversation history, memory, preferences

🧪 Example App Flow

1. Mic/UI captures voice → STT → text + language ID.


2. Chat: Pass conversation history + recent input to chat/completions.


3. Memory: Save messages in SQLite, enabling context carryover.


4. TTS: Speak chatbot reply using Bulbul model.


5. Extras: Users can upload files to parse or record call snippets for analytics.


6. Extend: Add translation/transliteration features under user settings.

🥰 Why It’s Lovable

Voice-first, warm experience — a true companion, not just software.

Multilingual & inclusive — understands and responds in 11 Indic languages.

Context-aware — remembers prior conversations.

Powerful features under one hood — voice, text, analytics, document parsing.

Built for India — script conversion, colloquial translation, voice-call support.

📌 Next Steps

1. Set up environment variables for SARVAM_API_KEY.


2. Build UI screens: Chat interface, voice recording, upload page, settings.


3. Integrate each Sarvam API one by one in functional modules.


4. Design robust local DB to store history, user preferences, last-used language.


5. Create end-to-end voice session: STT → Chat → TTS flow.


6. Add optional call recording & analytics.


7. Polish with animations, loading states, personalized voice avatars.

- magicpath ai for components 
- use uv package manager and steamlit {for simple web interfaces}
- oracle cloud for free server -> https://youtu.be/qVwo2P4uCZM?si=PYkFRXEGd9tJoTBi
- mobbin for user journey
- langchain for custom ai
- Goal is to - a startup idea to scale
- should solve the specific business problem
- should work flawlessly
- should have clean design
- throghly tested

-  Define your data models
-  what info i need to store
-  how it relates to other data
-  what those relationships look like
-  Do I absolutely need that for my app to function

# paper is cheap but code is expensive
- Step 5 - Draw a stupid simple prototype or very basic wireframe of your application.
Use a pad and pencil to create a basic page layout to draw the needed functions (where does the login form go?, What happens after a file upload completes?, How do I navigate between pages?, etc.)
-  basic wireframes for userflows

# right decisions and tradeoffs early on
-  Understand what the future of your project is going to look like.
Determine what type of project it will be in six months: one that will need to be able to scale up for many users?
- choose thats moe robust may require more work upfront

- Step 7 - Drill into the components.
Questions to ask yourself: Will it be just a simple script, or will it require a back-end API and a front-end interface? Will it be a browser extension? A mobile app? A web service?
What is the architecture of the project?
Think about how users are going to interact with your application, and what technical components you will require to make it work.
- Can i actually deploy this

- Step 9 - Overall development process.
This step is where coding begins.
*Create a project skeleton:
 -basic folder structure.
 -development environment.
 -version control.
*Setting up the database and creating data models.
*Build the back-end routes:
 -API endpoints.
*Front-end interface.
 -Connect to back-end.
*Project iteration.
