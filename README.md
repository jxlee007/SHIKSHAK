# SHIKSHAK

## Checklist (what I'll deliver)
- Summarize the project's purpose and repository metadata.
- Provide an annotated folder tree (placeholders marked if unknown).
- List features with concise summaries and associated technology suggestions.
- Add inline suggestions for APIs, workflows, and next steps.

## 1) Project Overview
SHIKSHAK is a web project focused on delivering educational content and course management capabilities. The repository's primary language is HTML and the default branch is `shishak-V1`. This README provides orientation, an annotated folder structure (estimated where repository listing was not available), and a concise feature matrix with suggested technologies and workflows.

If you want a fully accurate file tree, provide an `ls -R` output or grant read access so I can update the tree in-place.

## 2) Existing Folder Structure (annotated - verify contents)
Note: exact repository listing was not retrieved programmatically in this operation; entries marked as (verify) should be confirmed.

- If repository is purely static HTML/CSS/JS, backend folders may be absent.

## 3) Feature List
| Feature | Summary | Technology / API / Workflow |
|--------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Authentication & Authorization | User sign-up, sign-in, and role-based access (student/teacher/admin). | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: JWT for stateless auth or OAuth2 for external providers --> |
| Course & Lesson Management | Create, edit, and publish courses and lesson content. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: RESTful endpoints (POST /courses, GET /courses/:id) or GraphQL; DB: PostgreSQL --> |
| Lesson Editor (Rich Text / Multimedia) | WYSIWYG editor with media embedding and versioning. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: TipTap/Quill for frontend; media storage: S3 or equivalent --> |
| Student Dashboard | Enrolled courses, progress, and upcoming items. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: SPA (React/Vue) + state management + API --> |
| Assessments & Quizzes | Create quizzes with auto-graded and manual review flows. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: Grade endpoints and attempt records in DB; consider separate grading service --> |
| Notifications & Email | Email and in-app notifications for updates and deadlines. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: Background job queue (Bull/Redis or Celery) + SendGrid/Mailgun --> |
| Admin Panel | Manage users, content, and analytics. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: Admin panel (Django Admin or custom SPA) behind RBAC --> |
| Analytics & Reporting | Course completion, engagement metrics. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: Event tracking (Segment/Amplitude) or custom analytics queries in DB --> |
| Localization (i18n) | Support for multiple UI/content languages. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: i18next or built-in framework i18n --> |
| PWA / Offline Access | Optional offline access via caching and service workers. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: Implement PWA service worker and caching strategies --> |
| CI / CD | Automated tests and deployments. | N/A  <!-- Suggestion: GitHub Actions + Docker builds + deployment to cloud provider --> |

Inline suggestions: pick a consistent stack (example: React + Node/Express + PostgreSQL) and standardize API patterns (resource-based REST or GraphQL) for clarity.

Validation checklist:
- Project Overview: present ✓
- Existing Folder Structure: present (annotated; placeholders marked) ✓
- Feature List: present with suggestions ✓

Next steps I can take for you:
- Update this README with an exact folder tree if you paste `ls -R` output or grant access.
- Generate a proposed API spec (OpenAPI) and DB schema for key features.
