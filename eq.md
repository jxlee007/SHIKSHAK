🧩 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
App Name (TBD): Offline-first PWA for personal knowledge, task, and idea capture
 Purpose: Help users capture, organize, and act on any input — thoughts, tasks, inspiration, content — through AI-assisted mind mapping, even offline.

🎯 1. PURPOSE & PRODUCT VISION
Primary Goal: Ensure users never miss or forget ideas, tasks, inspirations, or knowledge — whether fleeting or strategic.


Product Philosophy:


 "Write it down, the rest gets done" – capturing something is half the job; AI helps close the loop to action or insight.



Unique Edge (Moat):


AI transforms raw inputs into structured outcomes (tasks, summaries, reminders).


Visual mind maps as the central interface for personal thought organization.


Seamless online/offline experience.



🔑 2. CORE FEATURES — WITH PURPOSE CONTEXT
Each feature is expressed in clear bullet points, with a “Why it matters” section below it.

📌 A. Multi-Modal Input Capture
✍️ Quick Text Notes: Fast entry with markdown or rich-text support.


🎙️ Voice Note Input: Capture thoughts hands-free; AI transcribes and adds to mind map.


📷 Image Input with OCR: Snap a photo (book, notes, whiteboard); text is extracted and linked to your mind map.


📄 Attach Offline Files (e.g., PDFs, articles) to any mind map node.


🧠 Auto Transcription & Inference (once online): AI converts voice/image into summaries, tasks, or insights.


💡 Why it matters: Users can capture anything, anywhere, in any form—even offline. Nothing is lost or delayed.

🌐 B. Smart Mind Map Engine (Knowledge Graph Core)
🔗 Auto-Mindmap Node Creation from any input type.


🧭 Context-Aware Node Placement: AI suggests where in your map each note fits.


🔍 AI-Powered Graph Search: Natural language querying of your entire captured knowledge.


📁 Clustering by Topic, Project, or Intent: Mind map auto-groups similar ideas or content.


✏️ Drag & Reorganize nodes visually; AI learns from your adjustments.


💡 Why it matters: A visual, AI-assisted mind map allows intuitive thinking, seeing gaps, and building knowledge with context.

✅ C. Task Management + Decision Nudging
⏳ Turn Ideas into To-Dos: AI suggests next actions or checklist items from notes.


📆 Task Reminders: Based on due dates, habits, or AI predictions.


🌱 Equilibrium Engine: Detects “gaps” in your plan and nudges you to finish what you start.


📊 1% Daily Progress System: Encourages small, consistent wins with visible streaks.


💡 Why it matters: Progress isn’t just about having ideas — it’s about executing them. This system closes the gap between thought and action.

🌄 D. AI Coaching (Morning & Night Sessions)
🌞 Morning Briefing:


What’s on your plate today?


AI selects top 3–5 things from your mind map/tasks.


🌙 Evening Reflection:


What did you do?


What’s next for tomorrow?


🔔 Delivered via System Notifications: Even if app isn’t open.


💡 Why it matters: Reflection + planning builds momentum. This keeps users grounded and guided without needing to remember themselves.

📚 E. Personal Knowledge Base
📥 Save Articles, Videos, PDFs — even offline.


✍️ AI Summarizes content into digestible highlights.


🧾 “Why did you save this?” Survey Prompt adds intent metadata to aid search/retrieval.


📌 Real-World Application Prompts: AI suggests how to use the info you saved.


📈 Growth Tracker: See how your knowledge base evolves and where you’re improving.


💡 Why it matters: It’s not just about consuming — it’s about turning knowledge into personal value.
