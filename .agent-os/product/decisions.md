## 2025-08-15: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

MindScape will be developed as an offline-first PWA using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Clerk for authentication/billing, and Convex for the backend. The app will focus on AI-assisted mind mapping with full offline functionality for knowledge workers and creative professionals.

### Context

The market lacks a truly offline-first mind mapping tool that can capture ideas instantly and organize them intelligently. Current solutions either require constant connectivity or lack AI-powered organization. MindScape addresses this gap by providing a seamless offline experience with intelligent content processing when connectivity returns.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Mind Mapping Tools (MindMeister, XMind)**
   - Pros: Established user base, feature-rich
   - Cons: No offline functionality, limited AI integration, expensive

2. **Note-taking Apps (Notion, Obsidian)**
   - Pros: Good organization, collaborative features
   - Cons: No visual mind mapping, limited offline capabilities, complex UI

3. **Task Management Tools (Asana, Monday)**
   - Pros: Good task organization, team collaboration
   - Cons: No mind mapping, no offline functionality, focused on project management

### Rationale

The chosen tech stack provides:
- **Next.js**: Excellent PWA support and offline capabilities
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for complex mind mapping logic
- **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui**: Rapid UI development with consistent design
- **Clerk**: Integrated authentication and subscription management
- **Convex**: Real-time database with offline-first architecture
- **AI Services**: Openrouter/Gemini for cost-effective AI integration
- **Langflow**: Visual AI workflow builder for easier AI chain management and prompt engineering
- **Offline-first approach**: Differentiates from competitors and addresses real user pain points

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unique market positioning with offline-first mind mapping
- Modern tech stack enables rapid development and scaling
- AI integration potential for intelligent content organization
- PWA approach reduces friction for users

**Negative:**
- Complex offline sync logic requires careful implementation
- AI features increase development complexity and costs
- PWA limitations on some mobile platforms
- Need to maintain both online and offline data consistency

## 2025-08-15: Development Approach

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Development will follow a phased approach starting with Phase 1 (Alpha) focusing on core UI components, offline infrastructure, and placeholder functionality. AI integrations and advanced features will be implemented in later phases.

### Context

Starting with the foundation ensures a solid base for complex features while allowing early user feedback on core functionality. The HTML reference provides clear UI specifications that can be implemented incrementally.

### Rationale

- **Risk mitigation**: Core functionality can be validated before AI integration
- **User feedback**: Early testing of UI/UX patterns
- **Technical foundation**: Offline infrastructure must be solid before AI features
- **Resource allocation**: Allows team to focus on one area at a time

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduced development risk
- Early user validation
- Solid technical foundation
- Clear development milestones

**Negative:**
- Longer time to market for AI features
- Potential user disappointment with limited initial functionality
- Need to maintain placeholder implementations
