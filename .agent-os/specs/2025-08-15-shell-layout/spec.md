# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Shell Layout
> Created: 2025-08-15

## Overview

Implement a persistent Header and Sidebar layout with responsive design to establish the core app foundation. This shell layout will serve as the primary navigation structure for all application views and provide consistent user experience across different screen sizes.

## Reference Materials

### Structure and Layout Guidance
- **C-V1.txt** - Unified component architecture and layout specifications
- **qwen-V1.html** - HTML prototype with working shell layout implementation

### UI Design Guidance
- **UI-reference/** folder - Contains visual mockups, component examples, and design patterns

### Technical Resources
- **Context-7 MCP Server** - For up-to-date library documentation and best practices
- **shadcn-ui MCP Server** - For component library usage and styling guidance

## User Stories

### Primary Navigation Structure

As a user, I want to have a consistent header and sidebar navigation that persists across all app views, so that I can easily navigate between different sections and maintain context of where I am in the application.

The header should display the app branding and provide access to global actions like search, notifications, and user profile. The sidebar should contain navigation links to main app sections (Mind Map, Tasks, Knowledge Base, Daily Rituals) and remain accessible for quick navigation between features.

### Responsive Design Experience

As a user on different devices, I want the shell layout to adapt appropriately to my screen size, so that I can use the application effectively whether I'm on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

On mobile devices, the sidebar should collapse or transform into a bottom navigation bar, while the header should maintain essential functionality without overwhelming the limited screen space.

## Spec Scope

1. **Persistent Header** - Fixed header with app branding, search functionality, and user profile access
2. **Navigation Sidebar** - Collapsible sidebar with main navigation links and responsive behavior
3. **Responsive Layout** - Mobile-first design that adapts to different screen sizes
4. **Layout Persistence** - Maintains user preferences and navigation state across sessions
5. **Accessibility Features** - Keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and profile management (handled by Clerk integration)
- Search functionality implementation (separate spec)
- Notification system (separate spec)
- Theme switching (handled by separate Theme System spec)
- Offline functionality (handled by separate Offline Infrastructure spec)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional shell layout with header and sidebar that renders correctly on all target devices
2. Responsive behavior that adapts the layout appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
3. Navigation state persistence that remembers user preferences and current location
4. Accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
