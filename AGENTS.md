# AGENTS.md â€“ SHIKSHAK AI Education Platform

## Project Overview
SHIKSHAK is an AI-powered educational platform built with Next.js 15, featuring a modular architecture with shared core and native shells. It supports real-time AI tutoring, gamification (streaks, badges), session management, resources, analytics, and comprehensive user management. Users can interact with AI companions via chat, referencing YouTube videos or PDFs, with context-aware answers and transcript logging.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Auth:** Clerk (initial), BetterAuth (future), with abstracted auth interface
- **Database:** Convex (initial), PostgreSQL with pgvector (future)
- **AI/ML:** OpenRouter (Gemini/Claude), orchestrated via LangChain
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel (initial), Docker & Kubernetes for scaling
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (initial), Prometheus (future)
- **TTS:** Saarvam / Veena integration
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/UI v4 (with references to `/shells/prototype/` folder for extra UI components)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Dev Tools:** Context7 MCP server for documentation

---

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Auth Abstraction:** Implemented to allow seamless switching between Clerk and BetterAuth in future.
- **AI Context Handling:** OpenRouter and LangChain chains support dynamic model switching and context-specific responses.
- **Content Storage:** No video uploads; YouTube and PDF transcripts only.
- **Web-First Approach:** Focus on responsive web app before mobile adaptation.
- **Fallback & Transition Plans:** Technologies are chosen for initial launch with planned migrations (Convex â†’ PostgreSQL, Sentry â†’ Prometheus, Clerk â†’ BetterAuth).

Execution Protocol for Jules

1. Sequential Execution: Follow tasks one by one. Only proceed after completing the current task.


2. Task Decomposition: Break large tasks into smaller subtasks if needed; implement all required logic for feature completion.


3. Status Updates: Mark task status in the table upon completion (âœ… Completed, ðŸ”„ In Progress, â¬œ Planned).


4. Devlog Maintenance: Use devlog.md for daily progress, errors, blockers, or special notes with date stamps.


5. Clarification: Pause and request clarification if requirements are unclear before proceeding.

UI/UX Reference: shells/prototype/ folder contains extra HTML/CSS/JS components and templates

AGENTS.md Standard: See OpenAI agents.md format

Best Practices: Follow modular, maintainable, and web-first design; implement abstraction layers for auth, AI, and DB.


This version includes:

- **MVP task table** updated to reflect current progress and decisions.
