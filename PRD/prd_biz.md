## The Problem

### Information Fragmentation

Users lose valuable ideas and insights because they're scattered across different apps, notes, and devices. 40% of knowledge workers report losing important information due to poor organization.

**Our Solution:** Centralized capture system with AI-powered organization and visual mind mapping.

### Offline Work Limitations

Current tools require internet connectivity, causing workflow interruptions and lost productivity. 60% of users work in environments with unreliable connectivity.

**Our Solution:** Full offline functionality with smart syncing when connection returns.

### Thought-to-Action Gap

Users capture information but struggle to convert it into actionable tasks and plans. Only 30% of captured notes become completed actions.

**Our Solution:** AI-assisted task generation and priority management with visual progress tracking.
